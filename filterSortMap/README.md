# Streams Play Ground

This is a simple multi-pom project to have fun and test java Stream API, completable futures and other new java 8 features. 

## filterSortMap

This is a functional example about filters, sort, and maps. 

- Talk about filters, it's talk about predicates.
- Talk about sort, it's talk about comparators.
- Talk about map, it's talk about functions.
 
 Once you have those concepts clear, then the only things that you should do is decouple predicates, comparators and functions from your business logic. So you will have domain objects, 
 DTOs, functions, predicates, comparators and managers (business logic) as a controller.  
 
 This project try to give an example of all of this concepts.
